  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2. HomePage.tsx now correctly gates MunicipalPortal behind authenticated municipal staff/admin checks (from profile, admin query, and sessionStorage), and LoginSelectionModal.tsx exports and uses a consistent SESSION_KEY_IS_MUNICIPAL constant written only after backend confirmation. The sessionStorage flash-prevention guard is preserved. All acceptance criteria appear addressed.",
