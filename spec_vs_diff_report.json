  "summary": "Both REQ-5 and REQ-6 appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-5 is addressed in ReportIssueDialog.tsx with auto-fetching geolocation on dialog open, reverse geocoding via Nominatim, inline loading/error states, and editable fields. REQ-6 is addressed in IssuesSection.tsx by checking isMunicipalStaff/isAdmin and conditionally hiding the Report Issue button and dialog. All major acceptance criteria appear covered.",

      "description": "Reverse geocoding via Nominatim API to pre-fill street, city, and zip code address fields as separate form fields",
      "reason": "REQ-5 mentions 'address if reverse-geocoded' only as a parenthetical optional item, but the implementation specifically calls the Nominatim API and populates distinct street, city, and zip code fields beyond what was explicitly requested.",
