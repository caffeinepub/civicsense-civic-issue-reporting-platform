# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Verify and document that the current UI state (version 35) does not match the original/initial application design.

**Planned changes:**
- Identify UI elements that still differ from the original design
- Document what the true initial state looked like for key components (Header, HomePage, HeroSection, CivicSenseAnimation, ReportIssueDialog, theme configuration)
- Confirm that version 35 is not the target initial state

**User-visible outcome:** The team will have clear documentation of the remaining differences between the current implementation and the true initial design state, establishing a baseline for any future restoration work.
