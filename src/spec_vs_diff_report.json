  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses REQ-28 by creating comprehensive documentation that identifies UI elements differing from the original design and confirms version 35 is not the target initial state. Two detailed markdown files document the initial design specifications and current differences across all major components (Header, HeroSection, CivicSenseAnimation, ReportIssueDialog, HomePage, theme configuration). Component files are annotated with inline documentation confirming alignment with initial design. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
